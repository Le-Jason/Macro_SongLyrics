    "It's been too long."
    "Battle... yes!"
    "When does the killing start?"
    "I... do not bleed."
    "What am I?"
    "No... pain... no... feeling... but hunger... "
    "Why do I feel... nothing?"
    "What toll have I paid?"
    "These wounds bring no pain."
    "This hunger... it gnaws."
    "The quiet... eats at me."
    "Where are they?"
    "How many battles have I won?"
    "I hated this waiting."
    "Where is the thrill of carnage?"
    "I need a slaughter!"
    "Always marching."
    "Forget the faces of the slain."
    "Slay the strong, trample the weak!"
    "Blood is the wine of victory."
    "Cowardice will be met with death."
    "Noxus suffers no cowards."
    "Death had its chance."
    "Only cowards fear death."
    "Victory is soaked in blood."
    "Break their will and their bones."
    "Winning is like breathing."
    "Our drums will drown out their screams."
    "You reek of fear!"
    "Come out and die!"
    "Your bones will pave my road to glory!"
    "More grist for the mill of war!"
    "Your snapping bones are music to my ears!"
    "I don't care what your name is!"
    "I know you... I want to remember killing you!"
    "Time to cut your strings, puppet!"
    "One of us will finally die today!"
    "We've clashed a thousand times... no more!"
    "I killed you once... I'll kill you again!"
    "I'll plant that banner in your corpse!"
    "Next in line, next to die."
    "Today, we'll see if ghosts can bleed."
    "Even death trembles before me."
    "You will be privileged to die... under my boot!"
    "You are not my general!"
    "I am not your pawn, Swain!"
    "You are weak, Swain! You are no leader!"
    "I had a funny bone, then I crushed it. Laugh, worm!"

    "It's murdering time!"
    "Your puny body is the only joke here."
    "Your... puny body is the only joke here."
    "You look just like your ancestor: dead!"
    "How many Jarvans must I kill?"
    "Four Jarvans, and you're all still failures! That is funny."
    "Why don't I have coverage for prosthetics?"
    "So, uh, Urgot. We can't hang out any more. I'm cool now."
    "Killing, I know."
    "Another corpse for the pile."
    "Ally, enemy... I don't care."
    "They'll never find all your pieces."
    "More enemies!"
    "My axe is getting cold!"
    "I will kill you all!"
    "I will break you!"
    "I must be sated!"
    "Give me an enemy."
    "I taste blood in the air."
    "I'll use their bones to pick my teeth."
    "I will ruin you."
    "Raise your weapon!"
    "Your life is mine!"
    "I'll pull you apart!"
    "I'll rip your head from your spine!"
    "Your cries disgust me!"
    "Bleed for me!"
    "I'll grind you to dust!"
    "I'll drown you in your own blood!"
    "I'll rip the meat from your bones!"
    "Blood will spill!"
    "I'll drink from your skull!"
    "Drink their blood!"
    "Run from me!"
    "I'll whet my axe on your bones!"

    "Shattered earth and bodies!"
    "Broken stone, broken bones!"



    "You are worms!"
    "A black eye for the earth!"
    "Even the ground trembles!"
    "Leave no stone unbroken!"
    "You're nothing!"
    "My blood burns."
    "Heat... and... rage!"
    "Fire in my veins!"
    "I feel no pain!"
    "Is that all?"
    "Think you can take me?"
    "You can't even scratch me!"
    "I hear the screams!"

    "Out of my way!"

    "You can't hide behind lackeys!"

    "You're mine!"
    "Get up! Fight!"
    "Is this what passes for war?!"
    "Chaaaaaaaarge!"

    "I'll crush you all!"

    "Nothing will stop me!"

    "I! Am! War!"
